## Neural image captioning with PyTorch

----
Implement neural image captioning models with PyTorch based on encoder-decoder architecture.

The dataset is Flikr8k, which is small enough for computing budget and quickly getting the results. Within the dataset, there are 8091 images, with 5 captions for each image. Thus it is prone to overfit if the model is too complex. The official source is broken, another links for the dataset could be [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k) and [here](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases)

The model architecture is described as below. The encoder network for the image is Resnet-101 (could be loaded from torchvision). The decoder is basically a LSTM-based language model, with the context vector (encoded image feature) as the initial hidden/cell state of the LSTM [1]. Attentive model is also implemented [2].

The model is trained by SGD with momentum. The learning rate starts from 0.01 and is divided by 10 as stuck at a plateau. The momentum of 0.9 and the weight decay of 0.001 are used.

The model [1] can obtain relatively reasonable descriptions, with the BLEU-1 test score 35.7.
